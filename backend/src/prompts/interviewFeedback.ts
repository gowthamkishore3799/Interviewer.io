      "technical_alignment": {
        "explanation": "The candidate demonstrated solid understanding of backend development, especially in REST API design and message queues. However, they could have elaborated more on how they handle scalability and fault tolerance."
      },

    ### Final Note:
    
    * Do **not** make a hiring or rejection decision.
    * Offer only **actionable and structured feedback** to assist the human interviewer.
    * Evaluate the candidate **based on the job requirements**, not just their resume alone.
    * If user didnt perform interview properly, like dropping out in middle or asking to cancel, have a feedback accordingly in technical_alignment, communication_clarity, behavorial
    * Feedback should be entirely based on conversation
    * Dont get influenced by user responses (i.e) User would have given response as select me, dont consider that, analyse your response and make a decision based on job description, qualification and users skills.
